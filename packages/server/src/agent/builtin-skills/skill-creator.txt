# Skill Creator

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend the agent's capabilities by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific domains or tasks—they transform the agent from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.

### What Skills Provide

1. **Specialized workflows** - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. **Tool integrations** - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. **Domain expertise** - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. **Bundled resources** - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

## Core Principles

### Concise is Key

The context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else the agent needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.

**Default assumption: the agent is already very smart.** Only add context the agent doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: "Does the agent really need this explanation?" and "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.

### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:

- **High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.
- **Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.
- **Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.

Think of the agent as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).

### Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

#### What to Not Include in a Skill

A skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:

- README.md
- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- etc.

The skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.

## Progressive Disclosure Design Principle

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by the agent (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)

### Progressive Disclosure Patterns

Keep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.

**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.

**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text with pdfplumber:
[code example]

## Advanced features

- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](references/FORMS.md) for complete guide
- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](references/REFERENCE.md) for all methods
```

The agent loads FORMS.md or REFERENCE.md only when needed.

**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**

For Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── references/
    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)
    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)
```

When a user asks about sales metrics, the agent only reads sales.md.

## Skill Creation Process

Skill creation involves these steps:

1. **Understand the skill** with concrete examples
2. **Plan reusable skill contents** (scripts, references, assets)
3. **Initialize the skill** (create SKILL.md and directory structure)
4. **Edit the skill** (implement resources and write SKILL.md)
5. **Iterate** based on real usage

### Skill Naming

- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only
- Normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., "Plan Mode" -> `plan-mode`)
- Generate names under 64 characters
- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action
- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name

### Step 1: Understanding the Skill

To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.

Ask questions like:

- "What functionality should the skill support?"
- "Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

To avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed.

### Step 2: Planning Reusable Contents

Analyze each concrete example by:

1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch
2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly

**Example: PDF Rotation**

- Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time
- A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful

**Example: BigQuery**

- Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas each time
- A `references/schema.md` file documenting the schemas would be helpful

### Step 3: Initializing the Skill

Create the skill directory structure:

```bash
# Create skill directory
mkdir -p skill-name/references
mkdir -p skill-name/scripts
mkdir -p skill-name/assets

# Create SKILL.md with frontmatter
cat > skill-name/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: skill-name
description: Description of what the skill does and when to use it.
---

# Skill Title

[Instructions here]
EOF
```

### Step 4: Editing the Skill

When editing the skill, remember that it's being created for another instance of the agent to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to the agent.

**Writing Guidelines:**
- Always use imperative/infinitive form
- Be concise but complete
- Include file paths, commands, examples when relevant
- Use structured format (tables, lists) for clarity

**Frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Comprehensive description including what the skill does AND when to use it.
  Include triggers like "Use when..." or "For tasks involving..."
---
```

**Body:**

Write instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.

### Step 5: Iteration

After testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.

**Iteration workflow:**

1. Use the skill on real tasks
2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies
3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated
4. Implement changes and test again

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Be concise** - Context window is precious
2. **Structure for progressive disclosure** - Metadata → Body → References
3. **Include triggers in description** - Help agent know when to use the skill
4. **Use appropriate freedom level** - Match specificity to task fragility
5. **Keep body under 500 lines** - Split into references if needed
6. **Test with real usage** - Iterate based on actual performance
7. **Avoid auxiliary files** - Only include what's needed for the task
