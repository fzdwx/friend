# HEARTBEAT.md

This file defines tasks that the agent will check periodically during heartbeat cycles.

**How it works:**
- The agent reads this file on each heartbeat (configurable interval, default 30 minutes)
- If there are actionable tasks, the agent executes them
- If no tasks or all completed, the agent responds with `HEARTBEAT_OK`

**Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat execution.**

## 💡 Tips

- Remove or comment out tasks you no longer need
- Check `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for recent activity logs
